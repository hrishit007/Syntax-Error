## Gesture Reactor
Application created for controlling basic features through gesture movement using computer vision. <br>
The idea was inspired by the growing popularity of AI in daily life. <br>
After the touchscreen era, we believe the future will be taken over by technologies through which devices are controlled using gestures. <br>
The motivation for this project was to learn more about openCV and AI/ML. <br>
The code has been written using python.<br>
The project openCV library of python along with numpy,pycaw,comtypes,tensorflow,mediapipe and others...<br>
First the program identifies the gesture we make and classifies it into 10 types, which are:<br>
thumbs up, thumbs down, peace, fist, rock, live long, okay, stop, call me and smile.<br>
Based on the gestures some functions are executed<br>
For eq:<br>
thumbs up will redirect to another window through which volume of the system can be controlled using thumb and index fingers<br>
        (pressing the key 'q' will exit the terminal)<br>
peace will redirect to another window through which brightness of the system can be controlled using thumb and index fingers<br>
        (pressing the key 'q' will exit the terminal)<br>
okay will take a screen shot <br>
call me opens microsoft teams<br>
smile opens camera<br>
thumbs down closes the program
