## Gesture Reactor
Application created for controlling basic features through gesture movement using computer vision. 
The idea was inspired by the growing popularity of AI in daily life.
After the touchscreen era, we believe the future will be taken over by technologies through which devices are controlled using gestures.
The motivation for this project was to learn more about openCV and AI/ML.
The code has been written using python.
The project openCV library of python along with numpy,pycaw,comtypes,tensorflow,mediapipe and others...
First the program identifies the gesture we make and classifies it into 10 types, which are:
thumbs up, thumbs down, peace, fist, rock, live long, okay, stop, call me and smile.
Based on the gestures some functions are executed
For eq:
thumbs up will redirect to another window through which volume of the system can be controlled using thumb and index fingers
        (pressing the key 'q' will exit the terminal)
peace will redirect to another window through which brightness of the system can be controlled using thumb and index fingers
        (pressing the key 'q' will exit the terminal)
okay will take a screen shot 
call me opens microsoft teams
smile opens camera
thumbs down closes the program
